# Efficient Frontier - Technology Stocks
This Python script performs portfolio optimization by generating a large number of random portfolios with a specified set of assets, calculating their expected returns, volatilities, and Sharpe ratios. It downloads historical adjusted close prices of the assets using the yfinance library, computes daily returns, average returns, and the covariance matrix, and uses these to calculate portfolio statistics. The script then plots a scatter plot of portfolio returns versus volatility, color-coded by Sharpe ratio, and overlays the Efficient Frontier, which represents the minimum volatility for each level of return. Additionally, it marks each individual assetâ€™s risk-return profile on the plot. The visualization helps in understanding the trade-off between risk and return for both portfolios and individual assets.
